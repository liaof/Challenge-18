# Challenge 18

### Task Summary

Create a Mongoose based back end for a simple forum infrastructure.

This week we had to make a Mongoose based database which forms the backbone of what appears to be a very simple forum. There are routes for account creation, as well as thread and comment creation. It even has a friends list system. But not only are there post routes to create these things, we also include the ability to delete and edit the things.

### Usage

Download into a git and npm initalized directory and run 'npm install' to install dependencies. Then type 'npm start' and go to http://localhost:3001/ in either your browser or Insomnia.
